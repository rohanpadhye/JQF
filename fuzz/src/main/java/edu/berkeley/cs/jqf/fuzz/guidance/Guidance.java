/**
 * A front-end for guided fuzzing.
 *
 * <p>Before each fuzzing trial, the front-end is
 * queried for input to be used as a source
 * of random numbers by junit-quickcheck's generators.
 *
 * <p>During a fuzzing trial, trace events are generated, and the
 * front-end provides callbacks to handle these trace events
 * (e.g. to collect branch coverage).
 *
 * <p>At the end of a fuzzing trial, the front-end is notified of
 * the result of the trial.
 *
 * <p>The standard sequence of method invocations on a Guidance
 * instance is as follows (in pseudo-code):
 * <pre>
 *     while (guidance.hasInput()) {
 *         Random rng = new StreamBackedRandom(guidance.getInput());
 *         Object[] args = generateInput(rng);
 *         try {
 *             runTest(args); // generates many trace events
 *             guidance.handleResult(SUCCESS, null);
 *         } catch (AssumptionViolatedException e) {
 *             guidance.handleResult(INVALID, e);
 *         } catch (Throwable t) {
 *             if (isExpected(e)) {
 *                 guidance.handleResult(SUCCESS, e);
 *             } else {
 *                 guidance.handleResult(FAILURE, e);
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * See the implementation of {@link FuzzStatement} for the real loop.
